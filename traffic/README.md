# TensorFlow Experimentation Process
## Defined a Sequential model and added different layers to it. Started with one convolutional layer (Conv2D), one pooling layer (MaxPooling2D), and one dense layer (Dense). Then added additional convolutional, pooling and dense layers with different parameters. Also experimented with the Dropout parameter.
